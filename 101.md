## Import Technique
### Common Js Import Technique
`const something = require('something')`
Common Js used a long time ago. Common Js is used in NodeJs. 

### ES6 
`import logo from './logo.svg'`

<br>
! Never use Common Js and ES6 together, since the way to export and import is different

## Text Customization
The different between toLocaleLowerCase() & toLocaleUpperCase() with toLowerCase() & toUpperCase() is that locale function check out our used language. This method is used when we use "difficult" language, ex: Arabic, etc

## Showing Data in React
To show data in react, we must use return. There are 2 ways:
1. Use return ()
```
loop.map((e, idx) => {
    return (
    <li key = {idx}>
        {e}
    </li>
    )
})
```
2. Use ()
```
loop.map((e, idx) => (
    <li key = {idx}>
        {e}
    </li>
))
```

## Ternary Operator
React does not understand basic JavaScript like if...else, etc. React only understand ternary operator. 

But we can use basic JavaScript before the return keyword

## Parent Element in Mapping
To show our contents (more than 1) using map, the contents must have parent element. The parent element can be an empty tag (<>).

<br> <br>

## Component
Since React has its own cons like, it doesn't create tag automatically, we can use component to help us. 

! Beware, component has same concept as class, so we need to use caps. 

To call the component, we need to use element tag (<>).

Since component is a function, the parameters can be shown by using properties in html

!Value to be shown, key to be thrown.

! Always remember, that if we want to show data (variable) in React, we must use {}
